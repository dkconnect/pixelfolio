## Project Overview

## File Structure
```
ðŸ“‚ Project Folder
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ index.html      # Main HTML file containing the website structure
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ styles
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ main.css    # Primary stylesheet for the website
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ responsive.css # Stylesheet for responsive design
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ scripts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ main.js     # JavaScript file for interactivity and animations
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ img            # Directory for images and icons
```

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** - Structuring the content
- **CSS3** - Styling and layout
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** - Interactive elements and animations
- **Google Fonts** - Custom typography
- **ARIA & Accessibility** - Improving accessibility

## Features
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Clicking navigation links smoothly scrolls to sections.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes using `responsive.css`.
- **Glitch Text Effect**: Dynamic glitch effect on text elements.
- **Pixel Dust Cursor Effect**: Interactive pixel dust effect on mouse movement.
- **Floating Animations**: Floating animations for decorative elements.
- **Dark Mode Ready**: Potential support for dark mode themes.
- **ARIA Accessibility**: Enhanced for screen readers and improved usability.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the portfolio.
3. Modify `main.css`, `responsive.css`, or `main.js` to customize the design and features.

## How It Works
- The **HTML** (`index.html`) contains the structure and semantic elements.
- The **CSS** (`main.css`, `responsive.css`) handles styling and responsiveness.
- The **JavaScript** (`main.js`) manages interactivity, animations, and effects.

## Future Improvements
- Add more sections and projects.
- Improve mobile responsiveness.
- Implement a contact form with backend integration.
- Optimize animations for better performance.
